## About The Project
Welcome to Wild Oasis! A hotel management web application where hotel staff can manage cabins, reservations and guests. In this project, I used Supabase as Backend and developed this project using advanced React topics such as React Query, HOC, ContextAPI, React Hook Form and ... üòâüèÖ

## üíõ Last Words
In this super application I learned to work with supabase and create authentication and backend systems and learned how to get data's from server using React Query or even update it and many other things that I learned it in React course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann.
