## Last Words
In this super application I learned to work with supabase and create authentication and backend systems and learned how to get data's from server using React Query or even update it and many other things that I learned it in React course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann.
